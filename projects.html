<!-- ================= INTRO ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <p>
    My projects reflect a strong interest in design for manufacturability (DFM),
    manufacturing systems, and operational robustness. Across UAV platforms,
    digital manufacturing tools, and computational research, I have focused on
    engineering solutions that balance performance with cost, scalability, and
    real-world deployment constraints.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 1 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Digital Inventory & Procurement Management System</h2>
  <p>
    Designed a digital inventory and procurement management system to replace
    manual vendor coordination in a small manufacturing environment. I defined
    the system architecture and procurement decision logic, including inventory
    tracking, sales logging, demand trend analysis, and reorder triggers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system emphasized proactive planning, reduced downtime, and data-driven
    operational decision-making. It included dynamic reorder point calculation,
    real-time stock visibility dashboards, and vendor lead-time optimization.

<!-- ================= PROJECT 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Low-Cost Modular UAV Platform</h2>
   <p>
    Designed and fabricated a low-cost, reduced-scale UAV to enable early and frequent
    testing without the cost and risk of full-scale manufacturing. The laser-cut plywood
    airframe used a modular, jigsaw-style assembly to allow rapid customization, repair,
    and reconfiguration.
  </p>

  <p>
    This platform enabled validation of flight behavior, subsystem integration, and
    assembly logic before transitioning to larger composite UAVs, reducing development
    risk and iteration time.

<!-- ================= PROJECT 3 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Disaster-Resistant Micro-Class UAV (AeroThon)</h2>
  <p>
    Led the mechanical design of a micro-class UAV intended for disaster response
    scenarios, tackling challenges such as high-wind operation, rugged landing,
    and rapid field deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design prioritized injection-moldable arms, crash-resistant fuselage
    structures, and an aluminum shock-absorbing landing gear. Extensive CAD/FEA
    analysis informed thickness distribution, load paths, and failure modes.

<!-- ================= PROJECT 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Autonomous UAV – RoboNation SUAS</h2>
  <p>
    Served as Manufacturing Lead for an international autonomous UAV competition
    team. I planned and executed fabrication strategies, selected materials,
    and developed tolerance-aware structural designs to meet aggressive
    competition deadlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Responsibilities included assembly sequencing, jig design, interference
    management, and vendor coordination for custom components. Trade-off
    decisions were documented to balance strength, weight, and manufacturability.

<!-- ================= PROJECT 5 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Industrial CFD Consultancy – Centrifugal Blower Optimization</h2>
  <p>
    Conducted CFD-based analysis of a centrifugal blower to achieve a specified
    pressure rise. Studied flow behavior and dimensional parameter sensitivity
    to guide geometry refinement under industrial performance constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis involved mesh convergence studies, boundary condition sensitivity,
    and performance maps across operating regimes. Recommendations were delivered
    with actionable geometry modification suggestions.

<!-- ================= RESEARCH SNAPSHOT ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Research Snapshot</h2>

  <h3>Computational Modeling of Radiofrequency Ablation (OpenFOAM + PINNs)</h3>

  <p>
    Developed a physics-based thermal model for radiofrequency ablation using
    OpenFOAM to study bioheat transfer and thermal lesion formation. To address
    computational bottlenecks, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) were
    integrated into the workflow to accelerate thermal predictions while
    preserving physical consistency.
