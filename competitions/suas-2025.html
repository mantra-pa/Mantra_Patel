  <h2>Competition Overview</h2>
  <p>
    RoboNation SUAS is an international UAV competition that evaluates teams on
    autonomous mission execution, system integration, and reliability across
    repeated mission cycles under operational constraints.

  <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    I served as Vice-Captain and Mechanical Lead, with responsibility for
    manufacturing strategy and structural design decisions. My focus was on
    ensuring the UAV could be transported, assembled, repaired, and redeployed
    efficiently during competition operations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defined manufacturing workflows and build sequencing</li>
    <li>Led composite fabrication and structural integration</li>
    <li>Designed modular interfaces for rapid subsystem replacement</li>
    <li>Planned assembly and logistics for field deployment</li>
  </ul>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Manufacturing & Operations Focus</h2>
  <p>
    Design decisions were driven by transport constraints, repeated assembly cycles,
    and rapid turnaround requirements between missions. Emphasis was placed on
    manufacturability, tolerance robustness, and minimizing operational failure points.
