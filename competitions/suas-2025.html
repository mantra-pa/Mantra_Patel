<!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Competition Overview</h2>
  <p>
    RoboNation SUAS is an international UAV competition that evaluates teams on
    autonomous mission execution, system integration, and operational reliability
    across repeated mission cycles under real-world constraints.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= ROLE ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    I served as <strong>Vice-Captain and Mechanical Lead</strong>, with responsibility
    for manufacturing strategy, structural design, and field-operational readiness.
    My primary objective was to ensure the UAV could be transported, assembled,
    repaired, and redeployed efficiently during competition operations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defined manufacturing workflows and build sequencing</li>
    <li>Led composite fabrication and structural integration</li>
    <li>Designed modular interfaces for rapid subsystem replacement</li>
    <li>Planned assembly, transport, and field-deployment logistics</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= KEY ACHIEVEMENT ================= -->
<section class="section highlight">
  <h2>Key Operational Achievement</h2>
  <p>
    The UAV was engineered for <strong>rapid field deployment</strong>, achieving
    a <strong>complete structural assembly time of under 5 minutes</strong>.
    This capability was enabled through a modular carbon-fiber rod architecture,
    reduced fastener count, and simplified mechanical interfaces.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= MANUFACTURING FOCUS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Manufacturing & Operations Focus</h2>
  <p>
    Design decisions were driven by transport constraints, repeated assembly cycles,
    and short turnaround times between missions. Emphasis was placed on
    design-for-manufacturing (DFM), design-for-assembly (DFA),
    tolerance robustness, and minimizing operational failure points.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Modular structure to enable sub-5-minute assembly</li>
    <li>Reduced joint count to minimize vibration and loosening</li>
    <li>Structural layouts optimized for repeated disassembly</li>
    <li>Manufacturing methods chosen for fast iteration and repairability</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= CAD DESIGN ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>CAD Design & Structural Layout</h2>
  <p>
    The UAV was fully designed in CAD with emphasis on load paths,
    manufacturability, and interface standardization.
    Structural joints and mounting interfaces were optimized
    to reduce part count and simplify assembly.
  </p>

<!-- ================= CARBON FIBER ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Carbon Fiber Manufacturing</h2>
  <p>
    Carbon-fiber composites were used for the primary structure and aerodynamic canopy
    to achieve a high stiffness-to-weight ratio while enabling rapid fabrication
    and on-site repair.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Material: Carbon fiber composite</li>
    <li>Components: Structural rods and aerodynamic canopy</li>
    <li>Process: Hand layup with mold-based curing</li>
    <li>Focus: Lightweight, structural rigidity, and fast turnaround</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ================= FINAL UAV ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Final UAV & Field Operations</h2>
  <p>
    The final UAV configuration was validated through repeated ground testing
    and field trials, with emphasis on structural reliability,
    vibration behavior, and maintenance efficiency.
