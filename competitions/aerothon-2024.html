<!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Competition Overview</h2>
  <p>
    AeroThon is a national-level aerospace design competition organized by SAE India,
    focused on developing UAV solutions for disaster-struck environments such as
    floods and cyclones. The competition emphasizes rapid manufacturability,
    operational robustness, and real-world deployability rather than purely
    theoretical performance.

<!-- ================= ROLE ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>My Role & Leadership</h2>
  <p>
    I served as <strong>Captain and Mechanical Lead</strong>, with responsibility for
    the overall mechanical architecture, manufacturing strategy, and structural
    reliability of the UAV. The role required balancing performance goals with
    manufacturing speed, cost, and ease of repair.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Owned end-to-end mechanical design of the UAV platform</li>
    <li>Defined manufacturing methods and material selection</li>
    <li>Designed modular and crash-resistant structural layouts</li>
    <li>Integrated design-for-manufacturing principles to reduce build time</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= MANUFACTURING FOCUS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Manufacturing & Operational Focus</h2>
  <p>
    The UAV was designed for rapid production and field repair, with emphasis on
    modular components, simplified joints, and tolerance-robust assembly. The
    architecture supported operation in light rain and high-wind conditions,
    enabling repeated missions with minimal downtime.
  </p>

<!-- ================= RESULTS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Results & Recognition</h2>
  <p>
    The team secured <strong>1st Place overall</strong> at AeroThon 2024 and received
    the <strong>Best Business Proposal</strong> award, recognizing both the technical
    execution and system-level feasibility of the design.
