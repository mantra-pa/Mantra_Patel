  <h2>Competition Overview</h2>
  <p>
    RoboNation SUAS is an international UAV competition that evaluates teams on
    autonomous mission performance, system integration, and reliability under
    operational constraints. Teams must design, fabricate, and deploy UAVs capable
    of repeated missions with minimal downtime.

  <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    I served as Vice-Captain and Mechanical Lead, with primary responsibility for
    manufacturing strategy and structural design decisions. My focus was on ensuring
    that the UAV could be transported, assembled, repaired, and redeployed efficiently
    during competition operations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defined manufacturing workflows and build sequencing</li>
    <li>Led composite material fabrication and structural integration</li>
    <li>Designed modular interfaces to enable rapid subsystem replacement</li>
    <li>Coordinated assembly planning and logistics for field deployment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Manufacturing & Operational Focus</h2>
  <p>
    Design decisions were driven by transport constraints, repeated assembly cycles,
    and the need for rapid turnaround between missions. Emphasis was placed on
    manufacturability, tolerance robustness, and minimizing failure points during
    field operations.
