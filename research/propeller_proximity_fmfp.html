<!-- ================= ABSTRACT ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Research Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Compact multirotor UAV configurations often require propellers to operate in
    close proximity due to geometric and packaging constraints. Such arrangements
    lead to aerodynamic interaction effects arising from wake interference and
    modified induced flow fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    This research investigates how close propeller spacing influences thrust
    generation and aerodynamic performance in multirotor UAV systems. The study
    focuses on identifying performance trends and understanding trade-offs between
    vehicle compactness and propulsion efficiency.

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The objective of this work was to analyze the effect of close proximity between
