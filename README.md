## 👤 About Me

I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate with strong interests in advanced manufacturing, computational design, and system-level engineering. My work integrates hands-on fabrication with simulation-driven design, focusing on translating theoretical concepts into manufacturable, scalable engineering systems.

Through participation in international competitions, research internships, and industry-oriented projects, I have gained experience in UAV design and fabrication, CFD and FEA analysis, and engineering decision-making under real-world constraints such as cost, manufacturability, and reliability.

My long-term goal is to contribute to high-impact engineering systems at the intersection of mechanical design, computation, and operations.
