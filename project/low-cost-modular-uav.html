<!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>
    This project was developed to address a recurring challenge observed during
    UAV development within Team Arrow: meaningful testing was frequently delayed
    until final deadlines because full-scale UAV manufacturing was expensive,
    time-intensive, and early failures often resulted in crashes and rework.

<!-- ================= DESIGN & CAD ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Design & CAD Development</h2>

  <p>
    The airframe architecture was developed with a strong emphasis on
    manufacturability and modularity rather than minimum weight or peak
    aerodynamic efficiency.
  </p>

      enable rapid assembly, replacement, and reconfiguration.

  </figure>
</section>

<!-- ================= MANUFACTURING ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Manufacturing & Fabrication</h2>

  <p>
    Structural components were manufactured using laser-cut plywood, enabling
    rapid turnaround, low cost, and repeatable fabrication without specialized
    tooling.
  </p>

</section>

<!-- ================= ASSEMBLY ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Assembly & Modularity</h2>

  <p>
    A jigsaw-style modular assembly was used to allow fast assembly, easy repair,
    and quick configuration changes without adhesives or complex fixturing.
  </p>

</section>

<!-- ================= TESTING ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Testing & Validation</h2>

  <p>
    The platform was used to validate flight behavior, control strategies,
    payload integration, and assembly logic before scaling designs to composite
    airframes.
  </p>

<!-- ================= ENGINEERING INSIGHT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Engineering Insight</h2>

  <p>
    This project demonstrated how manufacturing-aware design can accelerate
    learning and reduce system-level risk by enabling early and frequent testing.
    Rather than optimizing a single aircraft, the focus shifted to designing a
    development platform that supports iteration under real-world constraints.
