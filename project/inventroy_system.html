<!-- ================= CONTEXT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Problem Context</h2>
  <p>
    In small manufacturing environments, inventory and procurement decisions are
    often reactive and manually driven, relying on continuous vendor follow-ups.
    This leads to higher procurement costs, delayed replenishment, and increased
    risk of production downtime.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Project Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The objective of this project was to design a system-level workflow that
    integrates inventory tracking, demand estimation, and market-aware procurement
    timing to reduce costs while ensuring uninterrupted manufacturing.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= SYSTEM FLOW ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>System Flow & Decision Logic</h2>
  <p>
    When a production order is placed, the system generates the bill of materials
    (BOM) and checks current inventory availability. Required quantities are
    calculated, and demand is estimated using an EOQ-based approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Market prices are forecasted in parallel, and procurement costs are evaluated
    for both immediate purchasing and forecasted price conditions. If forecasted
    procurement costs are lower, required inventory is locked for baseline
    manufacturing while procurement is delayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once favorable market conditions are achieved, the procurement order is
    automatically triggered. Safety stock levels are calculated using distributor
    network variability, and projected future pump prices are displayed to support
    distributor-side ordering decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHY IT MATTERS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    In manufacturing systems, procurement timing often has a greater impact on
    operational cost and reliability than inventory size alone. This project
    demonstrates how integrating demand estimation, market forecasting, and
    decision logic can reduce procurement costs without increasing inventory
    holding or risking production continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system illustrates how data-driven decision-making can replace reactive
    vendor coordination, improving supply resilience and operational robustness.
