<!-- ================= PROBLEM CONTEXT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Problem Context</h2>
  <p>
    In small manufacturing environments, inventory and procurement processes are
    often managed manually through phone calls, spreadsheets, and informal vendor
    coordination. This approach leads to delayed replenishment, production downtime,
    limited demand visibility, and heavy dependence on human intervention.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVES ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>System Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable real-time visibility of inventory levels</li>
    <li>Reduce production interruptions caused by stock-outs</li>
    <li>Support proactive and repeatable procurement decisions</li>
    <li>Minimize manual vendor follow-ups</li>
    <li>Introduce data-driven planning into daily operations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The system was designed as a centralized digital workflow integrating inventory
    tracking, sales logging, demand analysis, and procurement decision logic.
    Every transaction updates the inventory state, enabling continuous monitoring
    and informed decision-making.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Inventory database with item-level tracking</li>
    <li>Sales and dispatch logging module</li>
    <li>Demand trend analysis component</li>
    <li>Reorder decision logic with threshold-based rules</li>
    <li>Vendor database with lead-time parameters</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= SYSTEM FLOW DIAGRAM ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>System Flow Diagram</h2>

  <p>
    The block diagram below illustrates the information flow and decision logic
    within the inventory and procurement management system, from sales data
    ingestion to procurement action.

      reorder decision logic, and vendor-based procurement actions.

  </figure>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROCUREMENT LOGIC ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Procurement Decision Logic</h2>
  <p>
    Procurement decisions were driven by a rule-based logic combining current
    inventory levels, historical consumption rates, safety stock requirements,
    and vendor lead times.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic reorder point calculation</li>
    <li>Lead-time-aware replenishment scheduling</li>
    <li>Demand trend monitoring for early risk detection</li>
    <li>Safety stock buffers for critical components</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= IMPLEMENTATION & VALIDATION ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Implementation & Validation</h2>
  <p>
    The system logic was validated using historical inventory and sales data to
    simulate normal and peak-demand scenarios. Stock-out conditions were modeled
    to evaluate system response time and reorder accuracy compared to manual
    procurement practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Performance metrics such as stock availability, response latency, and reorder
    reliability were monitored to assess effectiveness.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OUTCOMES ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Outcomes & Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved visibility of inventory status across operations</li>
    <li>Reduced reliance on continuous vendor communication</li>
    <li>Lower probability of unexpected production stoppages</li>
    <li>More structured and repeatable procurement workflows</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= KEY LEARNINGS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrated how system-level thinking and decision logic can
    significantly improve manufacturing operations without altering physical
    infrastructure. It reinforced the importance of integrating data flow,
    operational constraints, and engineering judgment into robust system design.
