      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate interested in advanced manufacturing,
        computational design, and system-level engineering. My work focuses on designing,
        analyzing, and fabricating engineering systems under real-world constraints such as
        manufacturability, cost, reliability, and time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through UAV design competitions, research-driven simulation work, and industry-oriented
        projects, I have worked on problems where engineering decisions must be validated through
        building, testing, and iteration — not just analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly motivated by environments that emphasize hands-on experimentation,
        analytical rigor, and learning by doing, where engineering intuition is developed through
        repeated design–build–test cycles.

<!-- ================= RESEARCH SNAPSHOT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>

  <p>
    My research interests lie in computational modeling and simulation-driven design.
    As a CFD & OpenFOAM research intern, I have worked on solver development, numerical
    efficiency, and the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to
    accelerate convergence in complex simulations.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in how computational tools can be combined with
    physical intuition to guide real engineering design decisions.
