      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in
        manufacturing-focused design, system integration, and engineering decision-making
        under real-world constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through international UAV competitions, industry-oriented projects, and
        research-driven simulation work, I have gained experience where design choices
        must balance manufacturability, cost, reliability, and deployment timelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly motivated by hands-on environments that emphasize
        design–build–test iteration and learning through implementation.

<!-- ================= RESEARCH ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>

  <p>
    My research interests focus on computational modeling and simulation-driven design.
    I have worked with OpenFOAM on numerical modeling of radiofrequency ablation,
    exploring solver efficiency and patient-specific analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in how physics-based simulation and data-driven
    methods can support practical engineering and manufacturing decisions.
