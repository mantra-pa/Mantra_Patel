<!-- ================= ABOUT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in
    manufacturing-focused design, system integration, and engineering
    decision-making under real-world constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience spans international UAV competitions, industry-oriented
    engineering projects, and simulation-driven analysis, where design decisions
    must balance manufacturability, cost, reliability, and deployment timelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly motivated by hands-on environments that emphasize
    design–build–test iteration and learning through implementation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= COMPETITIONS ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Engineering Competitions</h2>

  <p>
    I have participated in national and international UAV competitions that
    emphasize system reliability, manufacturability, and real-world mission
    execution. Through these programs, I have taken on leadership roles across
    mechanical design, manufacturing planning, and system integration.
  </p>

  <ul class="highlights">
    <li>
      <strong>RoboNation SUAS 2025:</strong>
      Vice-Captain & Mechanical Lead — led structural design decisions,
      manufacturing strategy, and field-operational readiness for an autonomous
      UAV platform.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>AeroThon 2024:</strong>
      Captain & Mechanical Lead — led the design and fabrication of a
      disaster-response micro-class UAV; secured <strong>1st Place</strong> and
      <strong>Best Business Proposal</strong> awards.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- ================= RESEARCH ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>

  <p>
    My research interests focus on applied computational modeling and
    simulation-driven design. I have worked with OpenFOAM on numerical modeling
    of radiofrequency ablation, including mesh refinement, solver stability, and
    reduced-order modeling approaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in how physics-based simulation and data-driven
    methods can support practical engineering and manufacturing decisions.
