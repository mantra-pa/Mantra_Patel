      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate with strong interests in
        manufacturing-focused design, system integration, and computational analysis.
        My work emphasizes building engineering systems that can be fabricated,
        assembled, tested, and iterated under real-world constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through international UAV competitions, research-driven simulation projects,
        and industry-oriented work, I have gained experience where design decisions
        must balance manufacturability, cost, reliability, and deployment timelines —
        not just analytical performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly motivated by environments that value hands-on experimentation
        and learning-by-doing, where engineering intuition is developed through repeated
        design–build–test cycles.

<!-- ================= RESEARCH SNAPSHOT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>

  <p>
    My research interests center on simulation-driven design and computational modeling.
    I have worked with OpenFOAM on numerical modeling of radiofrequency ablation, exploring
    how physics-based solvers and data-driven methods can support faster, patient-specific
    insights.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in how computational tools can inform practical
    engineering decisions when integrated with manufacturing and system constraints.
