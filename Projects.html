<!-- ================= INTRO ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <p>
    My projects reflect a strong interest in design for manufacturability (DFM),
    manufacturing systems, and operational robustness. Across UAV platforms,
    digital manufacturing tools, and computational research, I have focused on
    engineering solutions that balance performance with cost, scalability, and
    real-world deployment constraints.
  </p>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 1 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Digital Inventory & Procurement Management System</h2>
  <p>
    Designed a digital inventory and procurement management system to replace
    manual vendor coordination in a small manufacturing environment. I defined
    the system architecture and procurement decision logic, including inventory
    tracking, sales logging, demand trend analysis, and reorder triggers.
    The system emphasized proactive planning, reduced downtime, and data-driven
    operational decision-making.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Low-Cost Modular UAV Platform</h2>
  <p>
    Designed and fabricated a modular UAV platform optimized for low-cost
    production, rapid assembly, and field repair. Engineering decisions focused
    on part-count reduction, simplified load paths, vibration mitigation, and
    compatibility with CNC machining and additive manufacturing. The platform
    enabled faster iteration cycles while maintaining reliable flight performance.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 3 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Disaster-Resistant Micro-Class UAV (AeroThon)</h2>
  <p>
    Led the mechanical design of a UAV intended for disaster-response scenarios,
    including high-wind operation and rapid deployment. The design prioritized
    modular, injection-moldable arms, crash-resistant structures, and aluminum
    shock-absorbing landing gear. Manufacturing choices emphasized fast production,
    ease of repair, and operational robustness under harsh conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Autonomous UAV – RoboNation SUAS</h2>
  <p>
    Served as Manufacturing Lead for an international autonomous UAV competition
    team. Oversaw fabrication planning, material selection, tolerance-aware
    structural design, and assembly sequencing. Coordinated procurement and
    manufacturing trade-offs to achieve repeatable builds and reliable system
    integration under strict competition timelines.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 5 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Industrial CFD Consultancy – Centrifugal Blower Optimization</h2>
  <p>
    Conducted CFD-based analysis of a centrifugal blower to achieve a specified
    pressure rise. Studied flow behavior and dimensional parameter sensitivity
    to guide geometry refinement. The work focused on practical design improvement
    under industrial performance constraints.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 6 ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Computational Modeling of Radiofrequency Ablation (OpenFOAM)</h2>
  <p>
    Performed numerical modeling of radiofrequency ablation using OpenFOAM to
    study bioheat transfer and thermal lesion formation. Built simulation
    workflows for patient-specific parameterization while focusing on minimizing
    unintended thermal damage, under faculty supervision.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROJECT 7 ================= -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <h2>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Thermal Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    Extended prior thermal modeling work by integrating Physics-Informed Neural
    Networks to accelerate computation and enable faster patient-specific
    predictions. The focus was on reducing solver time while maintaining accuracy
    and improving usability of simulation workflows.
  </p>
